# YoreTude
This is a faithful recreation of YouTube from 2005. It is currently being developed by ShockAwer (aka jr[s], owner), billygoat891. and Jacobs (known for his site https://blips.club).<br>
It is intended to be a very close replica of YouTube, even more than BitView, trying to closely replicate every detail of a YouTube era they can find.<br> 
This site is <b>closed-source</b>. This is just a place for the developers to publish changes to the source code so ShockAwer can publish it to the site.
